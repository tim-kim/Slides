[Verse 1]
Our Father everlasting the all creating one God almighty
Through Your holy Spirit conceiving Christ the Son Jesus our Saviour

[Chorus 1]
I believe in God our Father I believe in Christ the Son
I believe in the holy Spirit our God is three in one
I believe in the resurrection that we will rise again for I believe in the name of Jesus

[Verse 2]
Our Judge and our defender suffered and crucified forgiveness is in You
Descended into darkness You rose in glorious life forever seated high

[Chorus 1]
I believe in God our father I believe in Christ the Son
I believe in the holy Spirit our God is three in one
I believe in the resurrection that we will rise again for I believe in the name of Jesus

[Bridge 1]
I believe in You I believe You rose again I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord

I believe in You I believe You rose again I believe that Jesus Christ is Lord

[Chorus 1]
I believe in God our Father I believe in Christ the Son
I believe in the holy Spirit our God is three in one
I believe in the resurrection that we will rise again for I believe in the name of Jesus

I believe in God our Father I believe in Christ the Son
I believe in the holy Spirit our God is three in one
I believe in the resurrection that we will rise again for I believe in the name of Jesus

For I believe in the Name of Jesus
For I believe in the Name of Jesus

[Chorus 2]
I believe in life eternal I believe in the virgin birth
I believe in the saints communion and in Your holy church
I believe in the resurrection when Jesus comes again for I believe in the name of Jesus
